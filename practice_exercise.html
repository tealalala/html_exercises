        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Yukihiro Matsumoto is a Japanese computer scientist and software programmer best known as the chief designer of the Ruby programming language and its reference implementation, Matz's Ruby Interpreter. His demeanor has brought about a motto in the Ruby community: "Matz is nice and so we are nice," commonly abbreviated as MINASWAN.</p>

        <h3>Quotes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>"Ruby inherited the Perl philosophy of having more than one way to do the same thing. I inherited that philosophy from Larry Wall, who is my hero actually. I want to make Ruby users free. I want to give them the freedom to choose."</li>
          <li>"In our daily lives as programmers, we process text strings a lot. So I tried to work hard on text processing, namely the string class and regular expressions. Regular expressions are built into the language and are very tuned up for use."</li>
          <li>"I believe consistency and orthogonality are tools of design, not the primary goal in design."</li>

        <h3>Works</h3>
        <h4>Ruby</h4>
        <p>Matsumoto released the first version of the Ruby programming language on 21 December 1995.[4][5] He still leads the development of the language's reference implementation, MRI (for Matz's Ruby Interpreter).</p>

        <h4>MRuby</h4>
        <p>In April 2012, Matsumoto open-sourced his work on a new implementation of Ruby called mruby.[6][7] It is a minimal implementation based on his virtual machine, called ritevm, and is designed to allow software developers to embed Ruby in other programs while keeping memory footprint small and performance optimised.</p>

        <h4>streem</h4>
        <p>In December 2014, Matsumoto open-sourced his work on a new scripting language called streem, a concurrent language based on a programming model similar to shell, with influences from Ruby, Erlang and other functional programming languages.[8]</p>
